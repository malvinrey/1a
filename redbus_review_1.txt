Our
first
trip
was
very
good
,
and
the
booking
went
smooth
.
However
,
when
I
'm
trying
to
use
my
'referral
code
'
in
my
friends
'
devices
,
it
's
just
not
working
,
showing
'something
seems
to
be
wrong
'
.
I
tried
to
use
the
'chat
with
us
'
in
the
app
,
but
the
'Help
'
section
is
not
even
opening
,
showing
some
webpage
error
.
Please
fix
it
soon
.
