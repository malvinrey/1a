I
had
a
medical
emergency
so
not
able
to
travel
and
tried
for
cancellation
but
directly
redbus
informed
that
I
ca
n't
cancel
my
ticket
and
even
I
tried
to
reschedule
as
I
have
to
travel
in
coming
days
but
then
also
it
's
not
possible
.
I
do
n't
understand
if
you
ca
n't
provide
any
of
this
options
then
what
services
you
provide
and
it
's
not
at
all
expected
.
My
experience
is
very
worst
and
has
occurred
loss
of
2500
.
